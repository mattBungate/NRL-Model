# NRL-Model
Using ML to make a predictive model for the NRL

# Data collection - Webscraper
For the data collection, I have used a webscraper on the NRL.com website to gather statistics of each game, dating back to 1999. In addition to this, I have used the csv file from australiansportsbetting.com for the betting odds on games from 2009-present. 

# ML application
I have taken inspiration from language models by taking a similar approach and using a similar structure. Instead of previous characters being used as the context to predict the next one, I will be using the previous games to predict the outcome of the next one.
